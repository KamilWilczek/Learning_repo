## phonebook-python
Simple program using dictionaries and shelve modules. Wrote it after taking a beginner python course on Udemy.

## toDoListJS
Just ToDoList (and another puppy died) with searcher wrote in JS after taking "Samuraj Programowania" course on Udemy.

## MyFisrtHtmlCssWebsite
I've made this simple page after taking "Samuraj Programowania" course regarding HTML/CSS. Header is implemented in JS. To scroll on click in nav I used jQuerry.
